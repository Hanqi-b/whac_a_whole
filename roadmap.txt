# Whac-A-Mole Game - Project Roadmap

Project Overview
A Rust-based Whac-A-Mole game using the Macroquad framework, featuring multiple difficulty levels, diverse enemy types, and AI-assisted development workflow. The project demonstrates proficiency in Rust game development, state management, and sprite-based graphics.

Tech Stack: Rust, Macroquad 0.4, rand 0.8

Development Progress

✅ Completed Milestones

Phase 1: Core Framework
- Set up Rust project with Macroquad and dependencies
- Established game loop architecture with state management system
- Implemented GameState enum (Menu, Playing, GameOver transitions)
- Created asset loading system for images and sprites

Phase 2: Asset Creation
- Generate images of Mole, Helmet Mole, Kobe Bryant and background as asset
- I can't generate Kobe Bryant so i use cat instead
- Create a Python script to pre-treat these images
- (parallel with phase 3) update the Python script and test it in the real game UI

Phase 3: Game Mode 1
- Mole spawn/hide animation system with randomized timing
- Click-to-hit collision detection
- Score tracking and 60-second timer
- Background rendering and UI elements

#### Phase 4: Game Mode 2
- Enhanced enemy variety system:
  - **Normal Moles**: +1 point, single hit
  - **Helmet Moles**: +2 points, requires 3 hits, visual health feedback
  - **Cats**: -5 penalty for misclicks
- Enemy type randomization with weighted spawn rates
- Multi-hit mechanics for armored enemies
- Penalty system for wrong targets
