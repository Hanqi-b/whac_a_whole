# Whac-A-Mole Game

A Rust based Whac-A-Mole game built with the Macroquad game framework, featuring multiple difficulty levels and game modes.

## Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes
- **Two Game Modes**:
  - **Game Mode 1 (Easy)**: Classic whac-a-mole gameplay with standard moles
  - **Game Mode 2 (Medium)**: Enhanced gameplay with:
    - Normal moles (+1 point)
    - Helmet moles (require 3 hits, +2 points when defeated, only retreat when health=0)
    - Cats (-5 points if hit by mistake)
- **60-Second Time Limit**: Score as many points as possible before time runs out
- **Interactive Menu System**: Easy-to-use button-based menu for difficulty selection

## Dependencies

- [Macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) 0.4 - Game framework
- [rand](https://github.com/rust-random/rand) 0.8 - Random number generation

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))

### Build and run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hanqi-b/whac_a_whole
cd whac_a_whole
cargo build
```

### Run
```bash
cargo run
```

## Controls

- **Mouse Left Click**: Hit moles or select menu buttons
- **Q**: Return to main menu (during gameplay)
- **ESC**: Quit game

## Gameplay

1. Start the game and select a difficulty level from the menu
2. Enable full-screen mode to ensure the game runs properly
3. Click on moles as they appear to score points
4. In Medium mode:
   - Avoid hitting cats (they deduct 5 points)
   - Control the amount of Helmet moles, it require multiple hits but give bonus points
5. Try to achieve the highest score within 60 seconds!

## Use of ai

Very few existing online Whack-a-Mole Rust projects are available, and those that exist are poorly implemented and unusable as-is. Therefore, with my instructor's approval, I utilized AI to generate the initial version of the game.rs code. This code currently includes only a hole and a symbol-drawn mole that periodically emerges from the map.

To enhance the project's aesthetics and completeness, I used AI to generate the initial versions of the main.rs and menu.rs code. During subsequent edits, some code was automatically completed by Copilot, while other sections were written by me—such as importing images, adding timers, and ensuring the UI and mole hit detection functioned correctly.

When writing game2.rs, I disabled Copilot's auto-complete feature. The AI's role was limited to suggesting code adjustments and ensuring Rust syntax was correct for proper execution.

The game requires image assets in the `images/` directory, these assets are generated by ai:
- `background1.png` - Game background
- `mole.png` - Normal mole sprite
- `helmet_mole.png` - Armored mole sprite
- `cat.png` - Cat sprite

Use the provided Python script in [`utils/process_blue_screen.py`](utils/process_blue_screen.py) to process images with blue screen backgrounds. The script is wrote with help of ai.

### Main Components

- [`main.rs`](src/main.rs) - Handles game state transitions and asset loading
- [`menu.rs`](src/menu.rs) - Implements the difficulty selection menu with [`draw_button`](src/menu.rs) and [`draw_menu`](src/menu.rs) functions
- [`game1.rs`](src/game1.rs) - Contains [`Game`](src/game1.rs) and [`Mole`](src/game1.rs) structs for Easy mode
- [`game2.rs`](src/game2.rs) - Enhanced [`Game`](src/game2.rs) struct with [`Mole`](src/game2.rs) enum supporting multiple mole types
